# FlickrApp
Code Challenge Project

## Description
A code challenge where I am to to build a small application that will display images from Flickr and optionally allow the user to search in those images as well.
Create a proxy API in .netcore (Flickr public API https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/ or something similar of your own choice)
Create a page that displays the public feed images in either a list or grid view."
